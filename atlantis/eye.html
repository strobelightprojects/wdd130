    <h3>Why Do people think the Eye of the Sahara could be the location?</h3>
    <p>The idea of the Lost City of Atlantis being located in the Eye of the Sahara, also known as the Richat Structure, has gained popularity in recent years due to similarities between the descriptions of Atlantis given by ancient Greek philosopher Plato and the geological features of the Richat Structure. The Richat Structure is a circular geological formation located in Mauritania, West Africa. It consists of a central dome surrounded by concentric rings of rock formations and sedimentary layers, which gives it a bull's-eye appearance when viewed from space.
     Some supporters of the theory that Atlantis is located in the Eye of the Sahara point to the similarities between Plato's descriptions of Atlantis and the geological features of the Eye of the Sahara.

    <h3>Why Do people think the Eye of the Sahara couldn't be the location?</h3>
    <p> The Eye of the Sahara is a geological formation that was created over millions of years by natural processes such as erosion and uplift. While it has a striking circular shape, there is no evidence to suggest that it was ever home to an ancient civilization. The age of The Eye of the Sahara is estimated to be around 100 million years old, which is far older than the timeframe in which the lost city of Atlantis is said to have existed, according to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. Despite many expeditions and investigations in the area, no archaeological evidence has been found to support the theory that the Eye of the Sahara was once home to a sophisticated civilization like Atlantis.While Plato's dialogues provide detailed descriptions of Atlantis and its culture, there are no other historical or literary sources that mention the city, which raises questions about its existence.
