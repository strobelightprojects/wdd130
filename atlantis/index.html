   <H3>What is the lost City of Atlantis?</H3>
    <p> The Lost City of Atlantis is a legendary city that has captured the imagination of people for centuries. The story of Atlantis comes from the writings of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, According to Plato's account, Atlantis was a powerful and advanced civilization that existed around 9,000 years before his time. The city was said to be located beyond the "Pillars of Hercules," which some believe to be the Strait of Gibraltar, and was home to a series of concentric rings of water and land, with a central island.

     Plato's description of Atlantis paints a picture of a utopian society with advanced technology, art, and culture, ruled by a series of benevolent kings. However, the civilization became corrupt and decadent, and was eventually destroyed by the gods as punishment for their hubris. Despite the enduring fascination with Atlantis, there is no concrete evidence to support the existence of the city.

    <H3>What is the purpose of this Website?</H3>
    <p> The purpose of this site is to inform visitors about potential locations for the lost city of Atlantis and why people believe it might exist or not. The website will provide brief information on two possible locations: the Eye of the Sahara and Cyprus, and will give reasons for why some believe it is there and why others think it is not.

        Another reason for this site is to educate people about the lost city of Atlantis and to encourage them to explore whether the city was a myth or if it actually existed, as described by Plato. Through presenting different theories and evidence, it is hoped that visitors will seek out more information and reach their own conclusions on the validity of Atlantis.
