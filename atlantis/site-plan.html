      <p>
        [I think people will come to my site to learn about the lost city of Atlantis and to determine for themselves if it is a myth or if the city did exist. I think the question they may have is if this really was a palace and if so why is there little to no records of it besides primarily Plato talking about it. 
        I think people will come to my site because it will have basic information that could get them interested in the topic. I think they will choose my site because I will take a neutral approach to whether the city is real which I feel a lot of other sites have a position on the topic making their points bais.

      <h3>The Eye of the Sahara</h3>
      <p>
        [I will need information about the eye of the Sahara. I can talk about how the area is covered with salt deposits which possibly come from i being covered in the water likewise the shape of eye if it was surrounded with water fits the description Plato gave in his book. I would like the audience to understand why people think this could be the location adn why others think it could’t be the location. I would like to cover know history of that location and other significant things about that region.

      <h3>Cyprus</h3>
      <p>
        [I need information about cyprus and what happened to the civilization there. How did all of the statute and different structures get to the ocean. Similar to the eye of the sahara why people thinks it could eb there and why people think it could’t be there. I think having a section of text for reasons why it could ebthere and another for why it might not be would be useful also it section about its history and see if there is any history about it being covered in water.
